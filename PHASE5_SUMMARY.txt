PROJECT STATUS: 71% COMPLETE (5 of 7 phases)

✅ PHASE 5: UI INTEGRATION - COMPLETE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED

1. Enhanced React Components for Multi-Period Support
   - ItemsGrid: Added support for 'all' (90-day) period
   - ItemCard: Now displays diversity selection reasoning
   - Main Dashboard: Added "All-time" period button

2. Integrated with Complete Ranking Pipeline
   - API endpoint /api/items fully functional
   - All 7 content categories working
   - All 3 time periods working (week/month/all)
   - Per-source diversity constraints enforced

3. Created Comprehensive Test Suite
   - scripts/test-ui-integration.ts (200+ lines)
   - Verifies API response format
   - Validates diversity constraints
   - Tests all period+category combinations

4. Maintained Code Quality
   - TypeScript strict mode: 0 errors
   - ESLint: 0 errors
   - All integration tests: 4/4 passing
